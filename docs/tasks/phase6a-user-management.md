# Phase 6A: User Management Implementation

**Version:** v1.1.0-phase6a-user-management  
**Date:** 2025-10-10  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

---

## 📋 Overview

Phase 6A implements a comprehensive user management system for the admin panel, replacing mock data with full Supabase integration. Admins can now create, edit, view, and delete users, as well as assign roles and manage user status.

---

## 🗄️ Database Changes

### Schema Updates
- Added `status` column to `profiles` table (active/inactive)
- Added `last_login` column to `profiles` table (timestamptz)

### RLS Policies
- **New:** "Admins have full access to all profiles" (replaced limited policies)
- **New:** "Prevent admin self-demotion" on `user_roles` table

### Security
- Admins cannot demote themselves from admin role
- All user operations require admin privileges
- Audit logging for user creation, updates, and deletion

---

## 🎨 Frontend Components

### New Pages
1. **`src/admin/pages/users/UsersForm.tsx`**
   - Create new users with email, password, name, phone, role
   - Edit existing users (profile, role, status)
   - Form validation and error handling
   - Success/error feedback

2. **`src/admin/pages/users/UserDetail.tsx`**
   - View detailed user information
   - Display user profile, role, status, permissions
   - Quick actions (edit, delete)
   - Permissions breakdown by role

### Updated Pages
1. **`src/admin/pages/users/UsersList.tsx`**
   - Removed mock data
   - Integrated with Supabase via `usersService`
   - Added user avatars
   - Action buttons (view, edit, delete)
   - Role-based UI (only admins see edit/delete)
   - Error handling and loading states

---

## 🔌 API Service

### `src/admin/api/users.ts` (Complete Rewrite)

**User Interface:**
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  full_name: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'editor' | 'viewer';
  status: 'active' | 'inactive';
  avatar_url?: string;
  phone?: string;
  created_at: string;
  last_login?: string;
}
```

**Service Methods:**
- `list()` - Fetch all users with profiles and roles
- `get(id)` - Fetch single user details
- `create(email, password, full_name, role)` - Create new user and assign role
- `update(id, data)` - Update user profile and/or role
- `remove(id)` - Delete user (cascades to profiles and roles)

**Integration:**
- Uses `supabase.auth.admin.*` for user creation/deletion
- Queries `profiles` and `user_roles` tables
- Logs audit trail for sensitive operations

---

## 🛣️ Routing Updates

### New Routes
```
/admin/users              → UsersList
/admin/users/new          → UsersForm (create)
/admin/users/:id          → UserDetail (view)
/admin/users/:id/edit     → UsersForm (edit)
```
